# Pypoll Election Analysis Challenge
Python Lesson

## Overview of Election Audit

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was provide the election commission county and candidate vote counts and percentages in a recent election, as well as determine the winning candidate, winning vote count and winning percentage using Python within VS Code.

## ELection-Audit Results

   *  *Breakdown of number of votes and percentages (of total votes) for each county*
      * County votes:

## Election-Audit Summary
Aside from determining county breakdown and candidate breakdown, if additional metrics are measured, such as age or race, this script could be used to provide those breakdowns. Race would need to be defined as a string variable, added to a list and the votes from a defined dictionary would be calculated. Age would need to be defined as integer that would be converted to a string; using a loop/if else statements, ages would be added to age ranges such as "18 to 25", "26 -32", etc. Additional nested loops would have to be included to provide race or age breakdown per candidate.
